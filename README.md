Current repository has extracted XML files ready for translation in [gamedata/configs/text](https://github.com/lehrax-gaming/true-localisation/tree/main/gamedata/configs/text) directory.

To suggest your own changes you can do one of the following:
- add comments to lines where you suggest to make edits
- fork and create PRs in your own repo
- request to be added as contributor


## Translation flow

1. Make edits in text strings
2. Test changes in game
3. Submit your changes via pull request

[!] Every XML file must start with `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1251"?>` line. The game engine does not support UTF-8 encoding!<br/>Although, latin letters would be displayed inentically for either one, accents and other non-[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters can and will not. Save your XMLs as [Windows-1251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251).

You may use [HTML entities](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_entities_4.asp) for special characters, but <u>verify that they display correctly</u> before you submit changes. **Make sure to replace** `&` **with** `&amp;` **if you use ampersands!**


## Changing language

- If your language is already officially in the game, just switch to it from the menu.

- If not â€” set language code in your `userdata/user.ltx` file.<br/>
  For example, for German: `g_language rus` > `g_language ger`

#### Requirements:

- [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

### Extract DB archives yourself

0. Make sure you have a suitable converter tool at hand (ex: [CoC DB converter](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/downloads/cop-coc-db-converter)), place `converter.exe`<sup>1</sup> in this directory next to _README.md_ file
1. Find localisation DB file from content/resources directory
2. Run the `./run.ts unpack` to automagically extract from _db_ files

### Create DB archives yourself

0. Make sure you have a suitable converter tool at hand (ex: [CoC DB converter](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl/downloads/cop-coc-db-converter)), place `converter.exe`<sup>1</sup> in this directory next to _README.md_ file
1. Create the DB files via `./run.ts pack`


### Settings

Here are [the default values](./settings.default.json) that you can change to suit your needs:

```json
{
  "content_order": [               // 1
    "resources",
    "language",
    "patches"
  ],
  "converter": "./converter.exe",  // 2
  "launcher": "./PlayGame.exe",    // 3
  "launcher_arguments": "",        // 4
  "i_verified_settings": false     // 5
}
```


1. Lower override higher, if files with same name are present in multiple archives (newer patches replace older files).
2. Executable that is used for conversion. __NOT__ provided here.
3. Executable that launcher the game.
4. CLI arguments to start launcher with.
5. A safety measure for you to check the settings once at least :)
